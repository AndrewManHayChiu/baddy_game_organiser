# Badminton Game Organisation

I am building an application to schedule games and record results for better match making at DTBA. 

Currently, it's just python code to work out the classes and logic.

There is no graphical user interface yet. I haven't thought of the GUI solution yet, but ideally it will be hosted in the cloud.
